QC.segmentation_stats(),

Calculate the number of genes that are not in the decode file.
This requires the input of the decode.hdf5.  Should decode.hdf5
be an argument to the function, or be a member of the QC class?

transcripts = adata.uns['transcripts']
# Get the gene names which have transcripts in cells.
in_cell = transcripts.loc[transcripts['cell'] != 0]['gene_name']
if genes < len(decode_df):
	diff = len(decode_df) = genes
